# RpcConsultingTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.4.

## To Run

 - Close this repo.
 - Run `npm install`.
 - Run `ng serve`
 - Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

## Notes on the Test

 - I wasn't sure how restrictive to be on the currency input. For now, users can only enter multiples of millions.

## What I would do with more time

 - Setup a WebAPI to get and put results.
 - Add paging in case there are lots of results.
 - Implement unit and integration tests.
 - Implement locale to format dates and currencies based on the user.
